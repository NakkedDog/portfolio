### Using Machine learning algorithms for Thailand housing price prediction
- Use of machine learning algorithms for foreseeing house values of single houses and condominiums in Bangkok, understanding the dynamic character of the real estate market as influenced by factors such as location, land area, and purchase price. Our study analyzes patterns and trends using an extensive dataset that includes essential property variables and several machine learning models, such as decision trees and boosting algorithms. We show that these methods are effective in predicting house values with varied degrees of accuracy using data pretreatment, feature engineering, and model hyperparameter tuning. The findings highlight the potential of machine learning to deliver significant insights for real estate stakeholders by improving predictive skills and refining accuracy in home price estimates, thereby contributing to the changing environment of real estate valuation.
### Main Challenges
- Developing a robust machine learning model for house price prediction poses several challenges, with one of the main challenges is the handling of missing data within the dataset. Null values can severely reduce model training and accuracy. To address this issue, a common approach involves dropping columns with an excessive (more than or equal 50 percent) number of null values, as they may contribute little to the predictive power of the model. Additionally, to maintain data integrity and enhance prediction capabilities, some rows are  filled with incorporating values that represent the majority of the dataset. Another crucial step is the identification and removal of outliers, as they can distort the model's performance by introducing noise and skewing predictions.
