### Python Projects
Semantic Segmentation
- Classify each individual pixel within the image form MSRC-v2 Segmentation Dataset with Pre-trained models and Convalutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Using Alexnet (Pre-trained) models as a encoder and Convalutional layer as decoder.

Medical Segmentation
- Classify breast cancer from ultrasound images dataset.
- Using U-net architecture to encode and create gourd truth image then train Convalutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the image.

House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
- Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers, and encode categorical variables. Feature scaling and normalization may also be applied to ensure consistent model performance.
- Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for regression tasks, such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines. Consider ensemble methods for improved accuracy.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the testing set. Adjust the model if needed for better accuracy.

### Internship/Work Experience
