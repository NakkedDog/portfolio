### Python Projects

House Price Prediction using Machine Learning (Data from GHBank)

- Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers, and encode categorical variables. Feature scaling and normalization may also be applied to ensure consistent model performance.
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for regression tasks, such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines. Consider ensemble methods for improved accuracy.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the testing set. Adjust the model if needed for better accuracy.
- Develop and visualize a comprehensive dashboard tailored for analysts, which highlights meaningful insights derived from the dataset. This includes importing the data, cleaning and transforming it as necessary, and using various visualization techniques to present the data in an informative and interactive manner.

### Mini Projects
House Price Data Visualization Using PowerBI
- Overview: Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize a comprehensive house price dataset. The project aimed to provide key insights into the housing market, supporting data-driven decision-making for real estate professionals and investors.-
- Key Features:
  - Metrics and Trends: Presented average and median house prices, price distributions, and trends over time to showcase market dynamics.
  - Comparative Analysis: Compared house prices across regions, property types, and other dimensions using bar charts, and line charts
  - Detailed Insights: Included analysis of price by square footage and days on the market.
  - Advanced Analytics: Conducted correlation analysis to explore relationships between house prices and other factors. Incorporated predictive analytics for future price estimation.
- Tools and Technologies: Utilized Power BI to create the dashboard, applying data visualization best practices and statistical methods to ensure accuracy and clarity.

Semantic Segmentation
- Classify each individual pixel within the image form MSRC-v2 Segmentation Dataset with Pre-trained models and Convalutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Using Alexnet (Pre-trained) models as a encoder and Convalutional layer as decoder.
-
